        <h3>Chrome Extension Campaign Monitor Helper</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Chrome Extension Campaign Monitor Helper</strong> is
            designed to streamline the process of importing HTML emails into
            Campaign Monitor by automatically disabling the "Move Inline CSS"
            option. This extension is especially useful for users who prefer to
            manage their CSS separately when working with Campaign Monitor.
